A Gopher server in Perl made as a joke in times when Gopher was still
supported at least in Firefox but absolutely superceded by WWW in all
practical applications.

It claimed to be the first ever UGC Gopher server because it
uses the search capability of Gopher to allow the generation of
new content by users.

It was also probably the only Gopher server using Russian language
and cyrillic letters.
